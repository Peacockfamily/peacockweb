		<h3>Some Time Later - 3/22/2016</h3>
		<p>
			While it has been a while, many projects have been coming along. Last week was the first project week, and I spent my time developing a Chrome extension that can grab text from a website and push it to a div sitting in front of the main screen. There's a decent amount I could do to add to it and turn it into a "finished product", but I'm happy with the learning experience so far. </p>
			<p> Today Andrew and I went into the city to get a little bit of work done and enjoy our respective breaks. We grabbed coffee out at Red Hat cafe and met Dad for lunch. It ended up being a lot of walking, but it was definitely a worthwhile experience. Afterwards, we went for a short tour around two of Adobe's SF locations, which served as a good motivator for why I'm doing all this. There are places where great products are made and where you can make a good living here in the city, so I'm excited to push myself and see how marketable I can become in the next few months.

		<h3>First Post - 3/8/2016</h3>
		<p>
			Clearly, the formatting has a long way to go, but I might as well start somewhere. This weekend, I got my raspberry pi-based power strip up and running, using the pi to control an 8-relay power strip in my room. At some point, I might share some information about that here.</p>
			<p> There has been an incredible amount to learn in this career change toward web development. In three short weeks, we have worked through the basics of shell, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap technologies, and a solid amount of Javascript. The pace is difficult, but there's some comfort in the fact that these components make up the core of all web technologies.
